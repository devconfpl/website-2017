							<h6>About the event</h6>
							<p>DevConf is one of Poland's premier annual conferences dedicated to software development. It's based on principles we believe are the success factors of an ultimate conference experience:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span class="highlight">inspiration</span> - regardless of technology, achieved by exchanging ideas</li>
								<li><span class="highlight">learning</span> - as a process occuring at talks but also during informal conversations</li>
								<li><span class="highlight">focus on people and interactions</span> - conference is about excellent sessions <strong>and</strong> great networking opportunities, we're eager to provide both</li>
							</ul>

							<p>If you are looking for a technology agnostic software development conference with high-level inspirational talks, deep dives into certain subjects, live coding sessions and plenty of networking time, make sure to book <span class="highlight">14-15th of September 2017</span> and come to <span class="highlight">Kraków, Poland</span>.</p>

							<h6>Workshops</h6>
							<p>Based on our experience from previous years, we do know that some of you look for more practical knowledge sharing sessions. Our pre-conference workshops are designed to deliver exactly that.</p>
							<p>On a day preceding the conference (13 September 2017) we're setting up full day workshops, so that some of you will be able to join and get their hands dirty with real things.</p>
							<p>Follow us to see what topics we are going to cover during this year's workshops.</p>

												<p class="description">Tired of seeing Artificial Intelligence applied mostly for advertising but not to benefit the whole population, a group of three Brazilians began in 2016 to analise open governmental data to detect corruption. The project, named after a Swedish scandal, is called Serenata de Amor Operation. “Serenata de Amor”, Portuguese for “love serenade”, is the name of a popular local chocolate brand. Publishing everything under an open source license the goal is to develop means for any person to detect misuse of public money as small as a candy bar. In a few months of work results account for 216 congresspeople reported for suspicious expenses, few thousand of tax Brazilian Reais returned to the government and more than a million detected for further investigation. With roughly 2k stars on GitHub, many people have been following the project and are anxious to know the next steps. It has been pointed as one of the most prominent Brazilian open source projects in 2016.
												<br/><br/>
												As the author of the project, I’m going to walk you through the technology and the context that made Serenata de Amor possible. Since everything is open source, it could be adapted and serve as inspiration for local efforts in the same sense.

												<p class="description">AI will be more important in making sense of data streamed in from IoT devices. What will happen when we will learn how to combine AI & IoT?
												<br/><br/>
												The Internet of Things (IoT) is converting the objects that surround us everyday into a community of information that will increase the quality of our lives. From small devices to houses, the IoT is leading more and more things into the digital fold every day. Sensors are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status, and in some cases, interact with their environment. Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of sensors have provided us with powerful applications that allow us to perform daily tasks by analyzing the huge amount of data. The insights to be gained from data are endless. In the light of this a new paradigm of combining AI and IoT has emerged, in which the quality of life could be increased through the use of big data and cloud technology. The talk includes a lot of real working IoT use cases and their potential impact of a combination IoT with AI. Their focus direct towards a more practical improvement of the quality of our life.</p>

You may have heard that Machine Learning is eating the world. Advancements in processing power and data availability have made AI progressing at an unprecedented pace. It beats humans in games in which humans were once unbeatable. It recognises cats from dogs. It helps win elections. You're probably getting an impression that with all of those complex equations it's too hard for a developer like you.
<br/><br/>
In this talk, I'll try to combat this impression. We'll look into the current state of Machine Learning, build and train basic prediction model and understand how it works. We'll also look at some cloud solutions that can be used withouth writing a line of code. Join me to see that you don't need to be a mathematician to use ML. I'll show you that you can incorporate it into your current projects right away without massive effort.</p>

													Machine learning has been leveraged to radically change many industry verticals. The problem is the learning curve has always been very steep. Exotic languages, complex tools, little or no documentation. But innovative cloud based ML platforms are changing that and democratizing access. During this session you will learn the basics of machine learning, and you will see a demo of how you can build a prediction model using real-world data, evaluate several different algorithms and modeling strategies, then deploy the finished model as a scalable RESTful API within minutes.</p>

													What’s the difference between teams that hit their goals quarter after quarter, and those that miss? Why do some teams become life-long friends, whereas others are riven by drama and rage-quitting? How does a team get the most value out of a practice like standup, and when is it just going through the motions?
													<br/><br/>
													In this talk, we'll discuss both philosophical approaches and specific methods to constructing a high performing team. We'll look at high- and low- functioning ways to do specific practices, like code review, as well as the big picture of how to keep everyone working happily together.
													<br/><br/>
													By the end, you’ll be inspired to process-hack on your own team to improve velocity and team happiness!

												<p class="description">.NET Standard is one of many new technologies to emerge from the mass of open source .NET initiatives during the past year. Compared to what’s come before, .NET Standard is not only a more effective way to use NuGet packages cross platform, it’s also way simpler. It has the potential to remove most, if not all, of the current confusion surrounding cross platform multi-targeting. So what is exactly is it and how does it work? How does it relate to .NET Core? Join Adam as he answers these questions and more, and takes a dive into some of the magic which makes .NET Standard work.</p>

Moreover, with the event of micro-services and with the combination of the Actor model, the fundamental design of this pattern can dramatically simplify the overall architecture of your application.

IoT devices are anticipated to surpass mobile phones as the largest category of connected devices as early as 2018 and are foreseen to reach 18 billion in 2020. It requires huge amounts of data to be transmitted but what is more important, it also requires a large number of simultaneous connections. This heavy uptake requires a different approach which gives more efficiency and lower energy consumption for every IoT device. To meet these requirements, technology must be revolutionized. It can be achieved with the next generation mobile network technology - 5G. This presentation will show you how 5G will power the Internet of Things!</p>

Cognitive systems are able to learn independently, build upon pre-programmed knowledge, understand natural language, and interact with human beings with reasoning and logic.

												In this session Mark will explore how, through the anthropomorphizing of machines, we are creating an environment of fabricated empathy that will change the human experience, and how we are asking machines to make ethical decisions that they’re grossly unprepared to do. He will also discuss why Artificial Intelligence won’t create an apocalypse of robots who take over the world. Maybe.</p>

												<p class="description">Real time applications are dominating the industry! Data is the main ingredient in Internet-based, social media and Internet of things (IoT) systems, which generate continuous streams of events used for real time analytics. This poses a tremendous challenge due to the massive volume of data collected and processed. These event-based Real-time analysis systems can easily process millions of messages per second through new generation solutions by simply defining small flows and then combining them together to create processing graphs. In this talk, will cover the concepts behind high-performance streamed-oriented big data processing systems. We will explore messaging queue systems like Kafka and Akka Streams which let developers define their process workflows at a higher level to define a graph system enabling a high throughput. You will learn how to integrate high performance stream message queues and how to define process workflows in C# and F#.</p>

												<p class="description">A few years ago, I had an idea to make the web better. It was going to be great, and I had the team to build it. Nine months of late nights and lost weekends later, we launched it! The problem: no one cared.
												<br/><br/>
												A brilliant project isn’t enough. I had to spread my vision, which was difficult for a developer like me. I learned quickly that even the best ideas needed to be sold. I had to build an audience, tell a story, and win over customers. Join me for a developer’s guide to marketing. I’ll share hard-fought lessons on page design, social networking, advertising, and analytics that will help you bring your ideas to the world.</p>

												<p class="description">You most likely write .NET code. Or Javascript. Do you even wonder how your machine “understands it”? You’re probably aware that it runs on VM, but what lies beneath it? We need to go deeper!
												<br/><br/>
												In this talk, we’ll look into x86 architecture, go all the way down to 0s and 1s and try to write some code on each level. If you know what is EAX, what INC does and know what pointers are, there may be nothing new in this talk for you, but you may enjoy refreshing the old days. If you have been writing Javascript whole your life, but you are interested what runs on “the metal”, you will like it.
												<br/><br/>
												I want to write code on each level, starting from the assembly, and showing how you can call lower code from higher abstractions and how things stack together in computers.</p>

												<p class="description">The greenfield project started out so promising. Instead of devolving into big ball of mud, the team decided to apply domain-driven design principles. Ubiquitous language, proper boundaries, encapsulation, it all made sense.
												<br/><br/>
												But along the way, something went completely and utterly wrong. It started with arguments on the proper way of implementing aggregates and entities. Arguments began over project and folder structure. Someone read a blog post that repositories are evil, and ORMs the devil incarnate. Another read that relational databases are last century, we need to store everything as a stream of events. Then came the actor model and frameworks that sounded like someone clearing their throat. Instead of a nice, clean architecture, the team chased the next new approach without ever actually shipping anything.
												<br/><br/>
												Beyond the endless technical arguments it causes, domain-driven design can actually produce great software. We have to look past the hype into the true value of DDD, what it can bring to our organizations and how it can enable us to build quality systems. With the advent of microservices, DDD is more important than ever - but only if we can get to the good parts.</p>

												<p class="description">With Twilio, building telecom applications has become a task that engineers do with any language. Applications can be built for things as simple as texting the weather to your phone each morning or as complex as running a call center. Elixir, built on Erlang OTP, is a perfect language for building modern telecom applications. With the easy to use concurrency model and hot code swapping you can build applications that don’t get bogged down by data processing and don’t drop calls when you’re pushing new code. This talk will answer such questions as “how do we alert everyone that there’s a zombie invasion?”, “which world leaders can make the call that the invasion is happening?”, and “what kind of zombies do I need to prepare for?”</p>

												When the basic set-up is up and running, Marcin will venture into making the system scale to many server instances.
												<br/><br/>
												Finally, you will learn about the concept of a backplane that forwards messages to all server instances so that a client connected to one instance can receive messages sent from another one. For dessert, Marcin will show you how to use Redis as a SignalR backplane.</p>

												<p class="description">Low-saturation scrum, "sort-of" microservices, misinterpreted (or trivialised) DevOps, not-so-Continuous Integration, Definition of almost-Done: who (honestly) haven't encountered any of these? Companies become grotesque in their mindless chase to imitate industry unicorns & in many cases it's our (software crafts(wo)men) fault: our ambitions & desires tend to drown out common sense & pragmatic thinking. What is even worse, in many cases we don't learn from failure by adopting the conclusions, but fool ourselves with painting the grass green.
												<br/><br/>
											  The idea of this talk is to present some war stories that involve modern development "cargo cults": emphasise errors made, underline the root causes of (partial or full) failure & suggest what could have been more successful (even if not so exciting / appealing ...). The goal is not to convince anyone that a rhino should stay a rhino, but that you probably should aim at being a unicorn at the top of your own league, if you want to advance further.</p>

												<p class="description">The collection of modern web browsers APIs and set of best practices on creating the applications turned into a new software creation methodology called Progressive Web Apps (PWA). The Service Worker API is a key API of the whole concept. Let me unleash its power for you! But with great power comes great responsibility - trivially, but true: I’ll show the examples of how easy the “Progressive” part of the PWA term could become “Regressive”, how to fix this, and how to test our Service Worker before deploying your app.
												<br/><br/>
												First, we’ll go through the well-known PWA functionality (App Shell, Offline Cache, Push) with focusing on the pitfalls we could easily get into, and how to avoid these.
												<br/><br/>
												Next, I’ll expand your horizons with the new PWA features, like Foreign fetch, Periodic sync, Navigation Preloads. And again - “handle with care”. I’ll share the points we have to pay attention to, as well as best practices.
												<br/><br/>
												As a practical result, you will get a full overview of basic and advanced Service Worker features, as well as knowledge on how to solve a real life project issues in the best possible way.
												<br/><br/>
												BONUS: I’ll share the latest additions to Service Worker and satellite APIs, so you will be ready to build the applications for the future!</p>

												<p class="description">JavaScript has established itself as one of the most popular programming languages. Spreading from the client side to the server side, it serves well in different situations. Furthermore, a new version, ES6, has been accepted and mostly implemented by all major browser vendors. JavaScript is however limited to what we, developers, could do in the browser. And we want to do a lot - video rendering, playing games, embracing mobile apps experience. All these things are already working today with the help of additional libraries and modules. However, Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla are already working on a new programming language - WebAssembly, that will bring low-level capabilities to the Web. What exactly is WebAssemby? Is this a threat to the well-established JavaScript? When can we expect to see it in action? In this talk I will provide some light into WebAssembly and will try to answer these questions. The Web is changing and we have to move on.</p>

												<p class="description">Writing a brand-new RESTful API using ASP.NET has never been easier, or so you’ve been led to believe. Create a project, write a few models, and scaffold – instant API for your website! While convenient, this leads to a lot of pain as your API scales. Testability and maintainability become more and more difficult as your codebase continues to expand. Eventually, you’re left with a huge mess of code and zero separation of concerns.
												<br/><br/>
												In this session, Spencer will provide a highly-opinionated and easy-to-learn pattern for creating scalable, maintainable APIs powered by ASP.NET Core. Attendees will learn about dependency injection, validating requests, executing requests via services, error handling, and versioning strategies to make sure your API lasts for the long haul.</p>

Then, I show you how code written in the functional, unidirectional way differs from your traditional OOP version, and the pros and cons that come with it. During my exploration of this new style, I decided to go “all-in” and totally buy into other people’s mindsets I’ll share with you the insights gathered during that process.

We'll tour the major features of NServiceBus and messaging patterns - One-way sending, request/reply, pub/sub, sagas and more. We'll also see what NServiceBus adds on top of messaging frameworks like Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, and more. Finally, I'll share some of my experiences bringing unreliable systems under control with messaging.</p>
